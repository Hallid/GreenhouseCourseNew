  # Expand Course Dates Table for Full Course Management

  ## Overview
  This migration expands the course_dates table to support comprehensive course information management including purpose, target audience, learning outcomes, key topics, assessment methods, and certification details.

  ## Changes Made

  1. **New Columns Added**
    - `purpose` (text) - Detailed description of the course purpose and objectives
    - `target_audience` (jsonb) - Array of target audience types stored as JSON
    - `duration` (text) - Course duration information (e.g., "10 days (80 hours)")
    - `nqf_level` (text) - National Qualifications Framework level
    - `credits` (integer) - Number of credits awarded
    - `accrediting_body` (text) - Name of the accrediting organization
    - `learning_outcomes` (jsonb) - Array of learning outcomes stored as JSON
    - `key_topics` (jsonb) - Array of key topics covered stored as JSON
    - `assessment` (jsonb) - Array of assessment methods stored as JSON
    - `certification` (text) - Certification details learners will receive

  2. **Column Modifications**
    - Change `upcoming_date` from text to date type for proper date handling
    - Change `id` from text to uuid with auto-generation

  3. **Data Migration**
    - Safely handle existing data during column type changes
    - Set default values for new columns

  4. **Security**
    - Add policy to allow public read access to course information
    - Maintain admin-only write access

  ## Notes
  - All array fields use JSONB for flexible storage and querying
  - Existing course records will have empty/null values for new fields initially
  - Date format will be standardized to ISO date format
